## Hola! 

I am Antony from ~~NY~~ (currently in Denver somehow). I am a software engineer with a passion for big data technologies and machine learning. I have experience developing applications for data collection and setting up entire data pipelines. I am also experienced in data science, especially in the fields of time series analysis and NLP. I enjoy to learn new frameworks, put ideas to the test (naturally skeptical), and automate repetitive tasks ðŸ¤–. And, because I canâ€™t say it enough, I love functional programming. Monads rock! ðŸ¤˜

I am currently completing a masterâ€™s degree in software engineering (only the final capstone left). I am open to embark on new adventures now, so letâ€™s roll up our sleeves and build things together.  
  
### Skills

- Fluent in Java, Scala, and Python. 
- Experience with multiple databases: Cassandra, HBase, Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Redshift, PostgreSQL.
- Working experience with the AWS ecosystem: EMR, Aurora, Kinesis, Lambda, EC2, S3.  
- Big Data tools: Spark, Hdfs, Kafka, Flume, MapReduce.
- Proficient with Python ML libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, PyTorch, Keras, ðŸ¤— Transformers.
  
### Projects:

â–« *Blockchain Ledger* - [README](https://sites.google.com/view/antony-gavidia/home/blockchain)  
Implementation of a blockchain ledger in Java. It handles transaction processing (users and balances validation), user accounts, and blocks (hash authentication and chain validation). It also implements a DSL and a file parser to process multiple commands from a text file.  
  
â–« *Blockchain Ledger with ZIO!* - [README](https://github.com/PyAntony/zio-blockchain)  
Implementation of a blockchain ledger with Scala using the [ZIO framework](https://zio.dev/). Similar to the ledger above, but with full support for transaction management and concurrency.  
  
â–« *NLP Topic Modeling* - [README](https://github.com/PyAntony/nlp-topic-modeling)  
Topic modeling application to extract top features and topics from a corpus. It supports supervised and unsupervised modes using Logistic Regression and Latent Dirichlet Allocation.  
  
â–« *Hate Speech Prediction* - [README](https://github.com/PyAntony/hate-speech)  
Project develops a model for binary classification on hate speech sentences. It uses the famous Bert (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model and compares fine-tuning vs. embedding strategies.   
  
â–« *Roshi Bets* - [README](https://github.com/PyAntony/video-games-betting-app)  
Prototype for a videogame betting app. Project aims to connect amateur gamers (home-streamed games) with gamblers. The goal is to heighten the competitiveness in small/local gaming events and let people earn some money in the process. Implemented with the Django framework.
